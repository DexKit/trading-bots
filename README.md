# DexKit Trading Bots

## Under high development, use it at own risk

This is the repo for the open source bots to be used on DexKit Dashboard and help users automate trades.

# Bots

The following bots are planned to be developed to run on the Dashboard:

- Buy/Sell Bot - most simple bot, is used to do a simple sell or buy
- Buy/Sell Bot with interval frequency - Used to buy or sell determined amounts at each interval, this bot could be used for projects to keep
trackers up to date with price, maintaining trading alive, for traders that wanna do DCA at determined project, or for traders that wanna sell their portfolio without impacting on token orderbook and price slippage.
- Place Buy/Sell limit orders Bot with interval frequency - Used to place buy or sell limit orders at each interval, this bot could be used by users that wanna sell and rebuy portfolio at premium prices and not wanna pay gas for their orders
- Market Maker Bot - used to place limit orders on both sides of the orderbook to other users fill, this could be used by traders to place several limit orders at different prices and profit from the spread. This bot is complex and is not intended to be used by begginers
